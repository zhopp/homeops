### Create Talos Secrets

Per cluster, only run gensecret once!

**Ensure that each cluster has it's own secret, failure to do so may result in nodes attempting to join other clusters.**

```sh
talhelper gensecret > talsecret.sops.yaml
sops -e -i talsecret.sops.yaml
```

**Generating secrets will overwrite all of the keys and there's no way to recover from it. This will brick the cluster unless you have some sort of backup**

### Create Talos Config
create a talconfig.yaml file following the documentation at https://budimanjojo.github.io/talhelper/latest/

After you have configured your talconfig, generate your configurations

```sh
talhelper genconfig
```

If this is your first time installing Talos, follow the below steps:
download the ISO that matches your talconfig setings:

```sh
talhelper genurl iso | xargs wget -P ~/Downloads
```

Flash a usb stick with that ISO image. This will be used to install Talos on the bare metal machine.
Boot from USB and Talos will install on the device into maintenance mode.

### Boostrap
* load the Talos image onto a usb and boot your device from it
* either statically set ip addresses or use DHCP reservations to obtain
  an IP address
* Run bootstrap script, this configures the nodes, bootstraps the nodes, and runs the `deploy-integrations.sh` script that installs the Cilium and the CSR approver

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

If you're enabling the tailscale extension and are not using a pre-defined authkey:

* Grab the tailscale login url:

```sh
talosctl -n YOUR_NODE_IP logs ext-tailscale
```

### Installing apps

Follow the README located [here](./k8s/bootstrap/README.md). Flux is used to install all apps and will take ownership of the Cilium and CSR deployment that was done during the bootstrap.

### Updates

if you need to make a change to your talos config run `talhelper genconfig` to generate a
new config with your added changes then run `apply.sh` to apply them

### Resetting your nodes

Reboot your nodes, and interrupt the boot squence to set the nodes into maintenance mode. After that, follow the steps from ["Create Talos Secrets"](https://github.com/zhopp/homeops?tab=readme-ov-file#create-talos-secrets) onward.

To wipe your Ceph cluster, follow the README steps [here](./k8s/apps/storage/README.md)
